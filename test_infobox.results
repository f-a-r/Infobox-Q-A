    | Description:    The New York Knickerbockers, commonly referred to as the Knicks, are a profession|
    |                 al basketball team based in New York City, New York. The team, established by Ned|
    |                  Irish in 1946, was one of the founding members of the Basketball Association of |
    |                 America, which became the NBA after merging with rival National Basketball League|
    |                  in 1949. The team plays at Madison Square Garden in the borough of Manhattan and|
    |                  is one of only two teams of the original National Basketball Association still l|
    |                 ocated in its original city. The Knicks were successful during their early years |
    |                 and were constant playoff contenders under the franchise's first head coach Joe L|
    |                 apchick. Beginning in 1950, the Knicks made three consecutive appearances in the |
    |                 NBA Finals, all of which were losing efforts. Lapchick resigned in 1956 and the t|
    |                 eam subsequently began to falter. It was not until the late 1960s when Red Holzma|
    |                 n became head coach did the Knicks begin to regain their former dominance. Holzma|
    |                 n successfully guided the Knicks to two championship titles in 1970 and 1973. The|
    |                  Knicks of the 1980s had mixed success that included six playoff appearances howe|
    |                 ver, they failed to participate in the NBA Finals.                               |

    | Description:    Steven Paul Jobs is the co-founder, Chairman, and CEO of Apple Inc and former CEO|
    |                  of Pixar Animation Studios. In the late 1970s, Jobs, with Apple co-founder Steve|
    |                  Wozniak, created one of the first commercially successful personal computers. In|
    |                  the early 1980s, Jobs was among the first to see the commercial potential of the|
    |                  mouse-driven GUI (Graphical User Interface). After losing a power struggle with |
    |                 the board of directors in 1985, Jobs resigned from Apple and founded NeXT, a comp|

    |                 ss markets. NeXT's subsequent 1997 buyout by Apple Computer Inc. brought Jobs bac|

    |                 e acquired the computer graphics division of Lucasfilm Ltd which was spun off as |
    |                 Pixar Animation Studios. He remained CEO and majority shareholder until its acqui|
    |                 sition by the Walt Disney Company in 2006. Jobs is currently the Walt Disney Comp|
    |                 any's largest individual shareholder and a member of its Board of Directors. He i|
    |                 s considered a leading figure in both the computer and entertainment industries. |
    |                 Jobs's history in business has contributed greatly to the myths of the quirky, in|

    | Description:    Jerome David Salinger was an American writer who won acclaim early in life. He le|

    | Description:    Ernest Miller Hemingway was an American author and journalist. His economical and|
    |                  understated style had a strong influence on 20th-century fiction, while his life|
    |                  of adventure and his public image influenced later generations. Hemingway produc|

    |                 ize in Literature in 1954. He published seven novels, six short story collections|
    |                 , and two non-fiction works. Three novels, four collections of short stories, and|
    |                  three non-fiction works were published posthumously. Many of his works are consi|
    |                 dered classics of American literature. Hemingway was raised in Oak Park, Illinois|
    |                 . After high school he reported for a few months for The Kansas City Star, before|
    |                  leaving for the Italian front to enlist with the World War I ambulance drivers. |
    |                 In 1918, he was seriously wounded and returned home. His wartime experiences form|
    |                 ed the basis for his novel A Farewell to Arms. In 1921, he married Hadley Richard|
    |                 son, the first of his four wives. The couple moved to Paris, where he worked as a|
    |                  foreign correspondent and fell under the influence of the modernist writers and |
    |                 artists of the 1920s "Lost Generation" expatriate community. The Sun Also Rises, |
    |                 Hemingway's first novel, was published in 1926.                                  |

    | Description:    Adolf Hitler was an Austrian-born German politician and the leader of the Nazi Pa|
    |                 rty. He was chancellor of Germany from 1933 to 1945 and dictator of Nazi Germany |
    |                 from 1934 to 1945. Hitler was at the centre of Nazi Germany, World War II in Euro|
    |                 pe, and the Holocaust. Hitler was a decorated veteran of World War I. He joined t|
    |                 he German Workers' Party in 1919, and became leader of the NSDAP in 1921. In 1923|
    |                 , he attempted a coup in Munich to seize power. The failed coup resulted in Hitle|
    |                 r's imprisonment, during which time he wrote his memoir, Mein Kampf. After his re|
    |                 lease in 1924, Hitler gained popular support by attacking the Treaty of Versaille|
    |                 s that had been forced on Germany and promoted nationalism, Pan-Germanism, and an|
    |                 tisemitism with charismatic oratory and Nazi propaganda. Hitler frequently denoun|
    |                 ced international capitalism and communism as being part of a Jewish conspiracy. |
    |                 Hitler's Nazi Party became the largest democratically elected party in the German|
    |                  Reichstag, leading to his appointment as chancellor in 1933. Following fresh ele|
    |                 ctions won by his coalition, the Reichstag passed the Enabling Act, which began t|
    |                 he process of transforming the Weimar Republic into the Third Reich, a single-par|
    |                 ty dictatorship based on the totalitarian and autocratic ideology of National Soc|
    |                 ialism. Hitler aimed to eliminate Jews from Germany and establish a New Order to |
    |                 counter what he saw as the injustice of the post-World War I international order |
    |                 dominated by Britain and France. His first six years in power resulted in rapid e|
    |                 conomic recovery from the Great Depression, the denunciation of restrictions impo|
    |                 sed on Germany after World War I, and the annexation of territories that were hom|
    |                 e to millions of ethnic Germans, actions which gave him significant popular suppo|
